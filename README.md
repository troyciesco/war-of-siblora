War of Siblora is a web3 game loosely based on a buildspace tutorial: https://buildspace.so/p/create-turn-based-nft-game. 

That tutorial provided the basic structure (especially the smart contract), but I'll be adding more features over time.

The idea of the game is to raise an army to fight against "The Empire" on a fictional continent called Siblora. It draws a lot of inspiration from Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - right now I'm even borrowing some faction names.

The game can only be played on the Rinkeby network. It's currently hosted at https://war-of-siblora.vercel.app/.

This is very much still a work in progress, but users can at least select a faction and run some simple attacks against the empire.

Some things I'm going to add:
- different unit types, like infantry, ranged, cavalry, etc.
- attack and defense multipliers to determine troops lost each skirmish
- the potential for units to get wounded instead of killed, and come back over time
- more logical battle set up, like facing a small part of the Empire army instead of the entire thing
- some sort of recruitment mechanism to build up the army
